    ! Suppose you deposit $50 per month in a bank account every month per year.
    ! Intrest at the rate of 1% is added to the balane after the deposit is made for each month.
    ! Write a program to compute and print the balance each month for a year.

    integer ::  year, period
    real :: rate, balance

    balance = 50
    period = 12
    rate = 0.01

    do year = 1, period
        balance = balance + rate * balance
        print*, year, balance
