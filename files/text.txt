Some Guidelines:

! - It is called Comment. Anywhere it precedes a code or statement, it means 
that the particular line of code won't be executed no matter what.

implicit none - This should start every one of your codes and should always 
be used. It prevents the compiler from confusing variables and names.

open(1, file = "title.txt") - Anytime you encounter a line of code like this, 
you should create a file with the specified name, e.g., payroll.txt.

Goodluck!
